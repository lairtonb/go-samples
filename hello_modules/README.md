# Intro

A module is a collection of Go packages stored in a file tree with a go.mod file at its root.

The go.mod file defines the moduleâ€™s module path, which is also the import path used for the root directory, and its dependency requirements, which are the other modules needed for a successful build. Each dependency requirement is written as a module path and a specific semantic version.

> As of Go 1.11, the go command enables the use of modules when the current directory or any parent directory has a go.mod, provided the directory is outside $GOPATH/src. (Inside $GOPATH/src, for compatibility, the go command still runs in the old GOPATH mode, even if a go.mod is found.

# Example

```
go mod init github.com/lairtonb/go-modules
```

The go.mod file is created:

```
module github.com/lairtonb/go-modules

go 1.15
```

With this command:

```
go get rsc.io/quote
```

The go.mod file is then updated:

```
module github.com/lairtonb/go-modules

go 1.15

require rsc.io/quote v1.5.2
```

And go.sum is also created:

```
golang.org/x/text v0.0.0-20170915032832-14c0d48ead0c h1:qgOY6WgZOaTkIIMiVjBQcw93ERBE4m30iBm00nkL0i8=
golang.org/x/text v0.0.0-20170915032832-14c0d48ead0c/go.mod h1:NqM8EUOU14njkJ3fqMW+pc6Ldnwhi/IjpwHt7yyuwOQ=
rsc.io/quote v1.5.2 h1:w5fcysjrx7yqtD/aO+QwRjYZOKnaM9Uh2b40tElTs3Y=
rsc.io/quote v1.5.2/go.mod h1:LzX7hefJvL54yjefDEDHNONDjII0t9xZLPXsUe+TKr0=
rsc.io/sampler v1.3.0 h1:7uVkIFmeBqHfdjD+gZwtXXI+RODJ2Wc4O7MPEh/QiW4=
rsc.io/sampler v1.3.0/go.mod h1:T1hPZKmBbMNahiBKFy5HrXp6adAjACjK9JXDnKaTXpA=
```

These two files are then used to resolve dependencies:

![module dependency](./docs/img/deps.png "Logo Title Text 1")

# Restore

Download all packages after clone, checking very source file:

```
go get ./...
```

This one downloads only deps listed in go mod:

```
go mod download
```

# Also See

To clean go.mod:

```
go mod tidy
```

# Clean cache

```
go clean -cache -modcache -i -r
```

# Restore Vendor Deps

To restore vendor deps that don't support modules:

```
go mod vendor
```

This creates a vendor folder for imports.

# See Module Versions

```
go list -m -versions rsc.io/quote
```

Outputs

```
rsc.io/quote v1.0.0 v1.1.0 v1.2.0 v1.2.1 v1.3.0 v1.4.0 v1.5.0 v1.5.1 v1.5.2 v1.5.3-pre1
```

Note the it does not list any major versions 2 or above though!?!

# GOPROXY and GOSUMDB

[TODO] look-up the docs
